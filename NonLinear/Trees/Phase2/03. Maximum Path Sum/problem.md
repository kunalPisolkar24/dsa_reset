# 3. Maximum Path Sum (Any Node to Any Node)

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum **path sum** of any non-empty path.

## Example Testcases

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation:
    1
   / \
  2   3
The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation:
   -10
   /  \
  9   20
     /  \
    15   7
The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [-3]
Output: -3
Explanation:
  -3
The only path is just the node itself.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 10^4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
